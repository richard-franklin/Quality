 # 1. Micro  and  Array  Update

Micro purchased an array A having N integer values. After playing it for a while, he got bored of it and decided to update value of its element.  In one second he can increase value of each array element by 1. He wants each array element's value to become greater than or equal to K. Please help Micro to find out the minimum amount of time it will take, for him to do so.

Input:
First line consists of a single integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of two space separated integers denoting N and K.
Second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.

Output:
For each test case, print the minimum time in which all array elements will become greater than or equal to K. Print a new line after each test case.

Constraints:

1<=T<=5

1<=N<=10^5

1<=A[i],K<=10^6

The TAs have released the marks of students in the form of an array, where arr[i] represents the marks of the ith student.

Since you are a curious kid, you want to find all the marks that are not smaller than those on its right side in the array.

Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer n denoting the number of students.
The next line will contain n space separated integers representing the marks of students.

Output Format

Output all the integers separated in the array from left to right that are not smaller than those on its right side.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000000

0 <= arr[i] <= 10000

After  getting  her  PhD,  Christie  has  become  a  celebrity  at  her  university,  and  her 
Facebook  profile  is  full  of  friend  requests.  Being  the  nice  girl,

algorithm to delete a friend. 
 
Algorithm Delete(Friend): 
    DeleteFriend=false 
    for i = 1 to Friend.length-1 
         if (Friend[i].popularity < Friend[i+1].popularity) 
            delete i th friend 
            DeleteFriend=true 
            break 
    if(DeleteFriend == false) 
        delete the last friend. 
 
Input Format

First line contains T number of test cases. First line of each test case contains N, the 
number of friends Christie currently has and K ,the number of friends Christie decides 
to delete. Next lines contains popularity of her friends separated by space. 
 
Output Format 

For each test case print N-K numbers which represent popularity of Christie friend's 
after deleting K friends. 
 
Constraints 

1<=T<=1000 

1<=N<=100000 

0<=K< N 

0<=popularity_of_friend<=100 
 
 
NOTE: 

Order  of  friends  after  deleting  exactly  K  friends  should  be  maintained  as  given  in 
input.
